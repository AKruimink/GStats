## About
Github Stats is a utility site that exists to solve the lack of information Github provides, especially around release data.
Often when a user releases a new application or version they are excited to see how well it's doing, only to find out that Github does not provide any real or meaningfull way of seeing data about it.
This usually leads to a path of navigating the Github Api to find some more information, which is a cumbersome job.

But not any longer, Github Stats is here to simplify this.
Want to see when and by whom a release was published? Github Stats!
Want to see the amount of downloads a release received? Github Stats!
Maybe interested in the total download count, the amount of watchers, stargazers or forks? Github Stats!
Anything you might want to know about a project in a simple and concise layout.

## Faq
**Why was Github Stats made?**
> There are basicly two reasons for the creation.
> - [WinReform](https://github.com/AKruimink/WinReform) had just gotton released and had a hard time finding out the amount of downloads it had obtained without manualy using the Github Api.
> - In an attempt to improve my web development skill as well as to experiment with TypeScript.

**Will there ever be a light themed version**
> The simple answer is yes, a light themed version is planned.
